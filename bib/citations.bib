  note = "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) repurpose natural signaling components to retarget T cells to cancer, but have shown limited efficacy in persistent, recurrent malignancies. To rapidly identify new CAR designs with clinical potential, I developed a multiplexed method called CAR Pooling. Forty CARs, with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages, were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified that enhanced CAR function relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and in particular CAR T cells which used the signaling domain from the B cell receptor for BAFF (BAFF-R) were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. I also showed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with BAFF-R in a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. These results demonstrate that multiplexed design and measurement of engineered receptors is a powerful strategy for understanding immune signaling and developing new and enhanced cellular therapies. \medskip \\ IP generated from this work, along with patented genome-editing methods developed with the Marson lab, became foundational technologies with which my postdoctoral advisors, Prof. Roybal and Prof Marson, co-founded Arsenal Biosciences. From 2018 to 2020 I served as a scientific consultant at Arsenal, helping to optimize and scale these tools into an exciting non-viral pooled T cell gene editing platform, which has developed new CAR-T therapies that are currently in clinical trials.",

  note = "Much of my graduate work focused on developing methods to increase the scale and throughput with which we can design, synthesize, and measure variants of genetic elements and genomes. Advancements in DNA synthesis now allow for the generation of complex pools of synthetic oligonucleotides, hundreds of bases long, which can be inserted into larger genetic systems and assayed in multiplex. Rather than random sequences generated by error-prone PCR or degenerate nucleotides, each sequence in the pool can be individually designed. To measure the effects of introducing these variants I developed a method called FlowSeq, which can accurately measure protein expression from a large multiplexed library. FlowSeq combines fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and a multiplexed barcoded DNA sequence readout to measure protein expression. Combining FlowSeq with DNA library synthesis and RNA sequencing has enabled our group and others to perform a targeted search of sequence space to answer specific biological questions, including the sequence-to-function relationships of non-coding regulatory elements, codon usage, RNA splicing, and protein activity. \medskip \\
  In work published in PNAS, we used this method to test a fundamental assumption in the synthetic biology community (and much of the broader biology community) that regulatory elements controlling gene expression can be combined rationally. Using next-generation DNA synthesis, we constructed over 12,000 RBS-promoter combinations and used our new multiplexed measurement methods to characterize the entire library in a single experiment. Overall, we found that while simple models explain much of the data, the large numbers of outliers will confound large system designs. More importantly, our new rapid synthesis and characterization methods provide an intriguing alternative to standardization or model refinement by generating and screening for desired expression levels in advance when building large genetic systems.",

  note= "Synonymous codon changes within genes can have substantial effects on protein expression, which have been attributed to differences in tRNA abundance and the structure of 5’ messenger RNAs, among other factors. We measured transcription and translation across libraries of over 14,000 defined genetic reporter constructs to separate and quantify the factors controlling protein expression, and identified that rare codon use at the N-terminus of genes in E. coli unexpectedly leads to a strong increase in protein translation. We then quantified the effects of individual codon use with expression changes and showed that the codons that affect expression are also selected for in E. coli genes. Furthermore, this rare codon effect is not mediated by variable ribosome elongation rates as others have suggested, but by the link between rare codon use and reduced RNA secondary structure. \medskip \\ These findings have large implications for heterologous gene expression, show that current de-facto standards for codon optimization are not ideal, and provide a straightforward method to improve them. This study was an early example of how large synthetic libraries combined with multiplexed measurements can answer outstanding genome-scale questions that are often difficult to address by analyzing natural sequence alone.",

At the scale of hundreds of these genomes, identifying and annotating the functions of mutations, comparing them among multiple clones, and tracing the genotypes and phenotypes across iteratively engineered strains becomes unwieldy without an integrated computational tool. To solve this issue, we built Millstone, a cloud-based platform for multiplex mutation analysis and iterative genome engineering. Millstone integrates alignment, variant-calling, genotype comparison, and visualization for hundreds of microbial genomic samples. In a paper published in Genome Biology, we show how Millstone has been used for in-house genome engineering projects and also describe its use in reanalyzing a published genome evolution dataset composed of over 100 experimentally evolved strains of E. coli.",

Here we develop a one-step process to enrich unlabeled cells containing knock-ins at multiple target loci using a family of repair templates named synthetic exon expression disruptors (SEEDs). SEEDs associate transgene integration with the disruption of a paired target endogenous surface protein while preserving target expression in nonmodified and partially edited cells to enable their removal (SEED-Selection). We design SEEDs to modify three critical loci encoding T cell specificity, coreceptor expression and major histocompatibility complex expression. The results demonstrate up to 98{\%} purity after selection for individual modifications and up to 90{\%} purity for six simultaneous edits (three knock-ins and three knockouts). This method is compatible with existing clinical manufacturing workflows and can be readily adapted to other loci to facilitate production of complex gene-edited cell therapies.},

              spectrometry recently emerged as a valuable technique for
              proteogenomic annotations that improves on the state-of-the-art
              in predicting genes and other features. However, previous
              proteogenomic approaches were limited to a single genome and did

              address the problems that remained beyond the reach of the
              traditional ``single proteome'' approach in mass spectrometry. In
              particular, we show how comparative proteogenomics addresses the
              notoriously difficult problem of ``one-hit-wonders'' in

              distinct from the other synonymous alternatives (CGN). We created
              a strain of Escherichia coli with all 123 instances of AGR codons
              removed from all essential genes. We readily replaced 110 AGR
              codons with the synonymous CGU codons, but the remaining 13
              ``recalcitrant'' AGRs required diversification to identify viable

              local ribosomal binding site-like motifs and local mRNA secondary
              structure, sometimes at the expense of amino acid identity. Based
              on these observations, we empirically defined metrics for a

              (TFAP4) construct that enhanced fitness of chronically stimulated
              CAR-T cells and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo.
              ModPoKI's modularity allowed us to generate an ∼10,000-member
              library of TF combinations. Non-viral KI of a combined BATF-TFAP4

To rapidly identify new CAR designs with clinical potential, I developed a multiplexed method called CAR Pooling. Forty CARs, with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages, were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified that enhanced CAR function relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and in particular CAR T cells which used the signaling domain from the B cell receptor for BAFF (BAFF-R) were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. I also showed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with BAFF-R in a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. These results demonstrate that multiplexed design and measurement of engineered receptors is a powerful strategy for understanding immune signaling and developing new and enhanced cellular therapies. \medskip \\ IP generated from this work, along with patented genome-editing methods developed with the Marson lab, became foundational technologies with which my postdoctoral advisors, Prof. Roybal and Prof Marson, co-founded Arsenal Biosciences. From 2018 to 2020 I served as a scientific consultant at Arsenal, helping to optimize and scale these tools into an exciting non-viral pooled T cell gene editing platform, which has developed new CAR-T therapies that are currently in clinical trials.",
