pooled KI screening (ModPoKI), an adaptable platform for modular
construction of DNA KI libraries using barcoded multicistronic

factors (TFs) and 129 natural and synthetic surface receptors

in diverse conditions identified a transcription factor AP4
(TFAP4) construct that enhanced fitness of chronically stimulated
CAR-T cells and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo.
ModPoKI's modularity allowed us to generate an ∼10,000-member
library of TF combinations. Non-viral KI of a combined BATF-TFAP4
polycistronic construct enhanced fitness. Overexpressed BATF and
TFAP4 co-occupy and regulate key gene targets to reprogram T cell
function. ModPoKI facilitates the discovery of complex gene
constructs to program cellular functions.},

 abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells dedicated to
suppressing immune responses to ensure immune self tolerance.
Treg therapy offers the opportunity to treat transplant rejection
and autoimmunity without the toxicity associated with
immunosuppressive regimens. Conferring antigen specificity to
Tregs using a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) dramatically
expands what targets can be pursued using Treg therapies.
However, the consequences of CAR-mediated signaling for human
Treg biology remain poorly understood. To address this, we
generated anti-CD19 CAR Tregs with a tandem CD28-TCRζ
intracellular domain. Upon in vitro co-incubation with
CD19-expressing cells, CAR Tregs upregulated activation markers,
proliferated, secreted IL-10, and suppressed T cell
proliferation, while maintaining high FOXP3 expression and a
demethylated TSDR. In humanized mice harboring CD19+ tumor cells,
CAR Tregs suppressed CAR T cell proliferation. Strikingly, CAR
Tregs also suppressed tumor growth, even in the absence of CAR T
cells. This phenomenon was observed across three tumor cell types
(B-cell leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and epithelial carcinoma) and
two routes of delivery (intravenous and subcutaneous). Real-time
monitoring of tumor cell survival and proliferation in vitro
confirmed that CAR Tregs suppress tumor cell growth.
Interestingly, single-cell cytokine analysis revealed that
CAR-mediated activation of Tregs leads to higher production of
IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and granzyme B than anti-CD3/28
stimulation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of granzyme B in CAR
Tregs diminished their antitumor activity in vivo. These results
demonstrate that CAR Treg cytotoxicity is an important concern
for safe clinical translation.},

 abstract = {Adoptive T cell therapies have produced exceptional responses in
a subset of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy
can be hindered by poor T cell persistence and function1. In
human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects
for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging
situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells.
Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to
improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the
effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell
signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in
tumours. We identify a gene fusion, CARD11-PIK3R3, found in a
CD4+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma2, that augments CARD11-BCL10-MALT1
complex signalling and anti-tumour efficacy of therapeutic T
cells in several immunotherapy-refractory models in an
antigen-dependent manner. Underscoring its potential to be
deployed safely, CARD11-PIK3R3-expressing cells were followed up
to 418 days after T cell transfer in vivo without evidence of
malignant transformation. Collectively, our results indicate that
exploiting naturally occurring mutations represents a promising

 abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) repurpose natural signaling
components to retarget T cells to refractory cancers but have
shown limited efficacy in persistent, recurrent malignancies.
Here, we introduce “CAR Pooling,” a multiplexed approach to
rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs
with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell
lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to
stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive
stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several
domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells.
CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell–activating factor
receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor
(TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced
relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen
stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell
into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism.
BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic
transcriptional signature previously associated with positive
clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB
intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in
a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–specific
CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of
multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is
a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and
activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies.
Description CAR Pooling is a high-throughput approach to screening
and testing CAR designs with the potential to enhance engineered T
cell therapies for cancer. Test driving CAR T cells CAR T cells
have already been through multiple generations, with each
iteration improving signaling through the receptor. However, a
strategy to broadly test multiple candidate intracellular
signaling domains would allow for even better optimization. Here,
Goodman et al. have developed CAR Pooling, a multiplexed approach
to rapidly identify the top CAR signaling domains. The authors
found using CAR Pooling that the intracellular signaling domain
from BAFF-R improved CAR T cell activity; these results translated
into control of tumor burden in vivo. Thus, CAR Pooling represents
an effective approach to rapidly identify strategies to improve
CAR T cells.},

frequency by ∼40-fold. We fundamentally improved the tolC
counter-selection by supplementing a second agent, vancomycin,
which reduces counter-selection escape by 425-fold, compared
colicin E1 alone. Combining these improvements in a mismatch
repair proficient strain reduced counter-selection escape
frequency by 1.3E6-fold in total, making tolC counter-selection
as effective as most selectable markers, and adding a valuable
tool to the genome editing toolbox. These improvements permitted
us to perform stable and continuous rounds of
selection/counter-selection using tolC, enabling replacement of
10 alleles without requiring genotypic screening for the first
time. Finally, we combined these advances to create an optimized
E. coli strain for genome engineering that is ∼10-fold more
efficient at achieving allelic diversity than previous best
practices.},

 abstract = {Recent proliferation of low-cost DNA sequencing techniques will
soon lead to an explosive growth in the number of sequenced
genomes and will turn manual annotations into a luxury. Mass
spectrometry recently emerged as a valuable technique for
proteogenomic annotations that improves on the state-of-the-art
in predicting genes and other features. However, previous
proteogenomic approaches were limited to a single genome and did
not take advantage of analyzing mass spectrometry data from
multiple genomes at once. We show that such a comparative
proteogenomics approach (like comparative genomics) allows one to
address the problems that remained beyond the reach of the
traditional ``single proteome'' approach in mass spectrometry. In
particular, we show how comparative proteogenomics addresses the
notoriously difficult problem of ``one-hit-wonders'' in
proteomics, improves on the existing gene prediction tools in
genomics, and allows identification of rare post-translational
modifications. We therefore argue that complementing DNA
sequencing projects by comparative proteogenomics projects can be
a viable approach to improve both genomic and proteomic
annotations.},

 abstract = {The degeneracy of the genetic code allows nucleic acids to encode
amino acid identity as well as noncoding information for gene
regulation and genome maintenance. The rare arginine codons AGA
and AGG (AGR) present a case study in codon choice, with AGRs
encoding important transcriptional and translational properties
distinct from the other synonymous alternatives (CGN). We created
a strain of Escherichia coli with all 123 instances of AGR codons
removed from all essential genes. We readily replaced 110 AGR
codons with the synonymous CGU codons, but the remaining 13
``recalcitrant'' AGRs required diversification to identify viable
alternatives. Successful replacement codons tended to conserve
local ribosomal binding site-like motifs and local mRNA secondary
structure, sometimes at the expense of amino acid identity. Based
on these observations, we empirically defined metrics for a
multidimensional ``safe replacement zone'' (SRZ) within which
alternative codons are more likely to be viable. To evaluate
synonymous and nonsynonymous alternatives to essential AGRs
further, we implemented a CRISPR/Cas9-based method to deplete a
diversified population of a wild-type allele, allowing us to
evaluate exhaustively the fitness impact of all 64 codon
alternatives. Using this method, we confirmed the relevance of the
SRZ by tracking codon fitness over time in 14 different genes,
finding that codons that fall outside the SRZ are rapidly depleted
from a growing population. Our unbiased and systematic strategy
for identifying unpredicted design flaws in synthetic genomes and
for elucidating rules governing codon choice will be crucial for
designing genomes exhibiting radically altered genetic codes.},
