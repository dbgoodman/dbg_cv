              components to retarget T cells to refractory cancers but have
              shown limited efficacy in persistent, recurrent malignancies.
              Here, we introduce “CAR Pooling,” a multiplexed approach to
              rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs
              with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell
              lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to
              stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive
              stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several
              domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
              receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells.
              CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell–activating factor
              receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor
              (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced
              relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen
              stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell
              into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism.
              BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic
              transcriptional signature previously associated with positive
              clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB
              intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in
              a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–specific
              CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of
              multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is
              a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and
              activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies.
              Description CAR Pooling is a high-throughput approach to screening
              and testing CAR designs with the potential to enhance engineered T
              cell therapies for cancer. Test driving CAR T cells CAR T cells
              have already been through multiple generations, with each
              iteration improving signaling through the receptor. However, a
              strategy to broadly test multiple candidate intracellular
              signaling domains would allow for even better optimization. Here,
              Goodman et al. have developed CAR Pooling, a multiplexed approach
              to rapidly identify the top CAR signaling domains. The authors
              found using CAR Pooling that the intracellular signaling domain
              from BAFF-R improved CAR T cell activity; these results translated
              into control of tumor burden in vivo. Thus, CAR Pooling represents
              an effective approach to rapidly identify strategies to improve
              CAR T cells.",

              and AGG (AGR) present a case study in codon choice, with AGRs
              encoding important transcriptional and translational properties
              distinct from the other synonymous alternatives (CGN). We created
              a strain of Escherichia coli with all 123 instances of AGR codons
              removed from all essential genes. We readily replaced 110 AGR
              codons with the synonymous CGU codons, but the remaining 13
              ``recalcitrant'' AGRs required diversification to identify viable
              alternatives. Successful replacement codons tended to conserve
              local ribosomal binding site-like motifs and local mRNA secondary
              structure, sometimes at the expense of amino acid identity. Based
              on these observations, we empirically defined metrics for a
              multidimensional ``safe replacement zone'' (SRZ) within which

              synonymous and nonsynonymous alternatives to essential AGRs

              diversified population of a wild-type allele, allowing us to
              evaluate exhaustively the fitness impact of all 64 codon
              alternatives. Using this method, we confirmed the relevance of the
              SRZ by tracking codon fitness over time in 14 different genes,

               human T cell cancers, evolution of the disease positively selects
               for mutations that improve fitness of T cells in challenging
               situations analogous to those faced by therapeutic T cells.
               Therefore, we reasoned that these mutations could be co-opted to
               improve T cell therapies. Here we systematically screened the
               effects of 71 mutations from T cell neoplasms on T cell
               signalling, cytokine production and in vivo persistence in

               Treg therapy offers the opportunity to treat transplant rejection
               and autoimmunity without the toxicity associated with

               However, the consequences of CAR-mediated signaling for human
               Treg biology remain poorly understood. To address this, we
               generated anti-CD19 CAR Tregs with a tandem CD28-TCRζ
               intracellular domain. Upon in vitro co-incubation with
               CD19-expressing cells, CAR Tregs upregulated activation markers,
               proliferated, secreted IL-10, and suppressed T cell
               proliferation, while maintaining high FOXP3 expression and a
               demethylated TSDR. In humanized mice harboring CD19+ tumor cells,
               CAR Tregs suppressed CAR T cell proliferation. Strikingly, CAR
               Tregs also suppressed tumor growth, even in the absence of CAR T
               cells. This phenomenon was observed across three tumor cell types
               (B-cell leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and epithelial carcinoma) and
               two routes of delivery (intravenous and subcutaneous). Real-time
               monitoring of tumor cell survival and proliferation in vitro
               confirmed that CAR Tregs suppress tumor cell growth.
               Interestingly, single-cell cytokine analysis revealed that
               CAR-mediated activation of Tregs leads to higher production of
               IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and granzyme B than anti-CD3/28
               stimulation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of granzyme B in CAR
               Tregs diminished their antitumor activity in vivo. These results

               components to retarget T cells to refractory cancers but have
               shown limited efficacy in persistent, recurrent malignancies.
               Here, we introduce ``CAR Pooling,'' a multiplexed approach to
               rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs
               with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell
               lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to
               stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive
               stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several
               domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
               receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells.
               CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell-activating factor
               receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor
               (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced
               relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen
               stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell
               into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism.
               BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic
               transcriptional signature previously associated with positive
               clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB
               intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain
               in a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen
               (BCMA)-specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a
               xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. Together, these results
               show that CAR Pooling is a general approach for rapid exploration
               of CAR architecture and activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T
               cell therapies.",

               spectrometry recently emerged as a valuable technique for
               proteogenomic annotations that improves on the state-of-the-art
               in predicting genes and other features. However, previous
               proteogenomic approaches were limited to a single genome and did
               not take advantage of analyzing mass spectrometry data from
               multiple genomes at once. We show that such a comparative
               proteogenomics approach (like comparative genomics) allows one to
               address the problems that remained beyond the reach of the
               traditional ``single proteome'' approach in mass spectrometry. In
               particular, we show how comparative proteogenomics addresses the
               notoriously difficult problem of ``one-hit-wonders'' in
               proteomics, improves on the existing gene prediction tools in
               genomics, and allows identification of rare post-translational

               a viable approach to improve both genomic and proteomic

               transmembrane transport in E. coli, has been implemented as a
               selectable/counter-selectable marker, but counter-selection
               escape frequency using colicin E1 precludes using tolC for
               inefficient genetic manipulations and/or with large libraries.
               Here, we leveraged unbiased deep sequencing of 96 independent
               lineages exhibiting counter-selection escape to identify
               loss-of-function mutations, which offered mechanistic insight and

               adaptable technology to barcode and track targeted integrations
               of large non-viral DNA templates and applied it to perform pooled
               knockin screens in primary human T cells. Pooled knockin of
               dozens of unique barcoded templates into the T cell receptor
               (TCR)-locus revealed gene constructs that enhanced fitness in
               vitro and in vivo. We further developed pooled knockin sequencing
               (PoKI-seq), combining single-cell transcriptome analysis and
               pooled knockin screening to measure cell abundance and cell state
               ex vivo and in vivo. This platform nominated a novel transforming
               growth factor β (TGF-β) R2-41BB chimeric receptor that improved
               solid tumor clearance. Pooled knockin screening enables
               parallelized re-writing of endogenous genetic sequences to
               accelerate discovery of knockin programs for cell therapies.",

               genome editing in clinically relevant primary cell types.
               Truncated Cas9 target sequences (tCTSs) added at the ends of the
               homology-directed repair (HDR) template interact with Cas9
               ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to shuttle the template to the nucleus,
               enhancing HDR efficiency approximately two- to fourfold.
               Furthermore, stabilizing Cas9 RNPs into nanoparticles with
               polyglutamic acid further improves editing efficiency by
               approximately twofold, reduces toxicity, and enables lyophilized
               storage without loss of activity. Combining the two improvements
               increases gene targeting efficiency even at reduced HDR template
